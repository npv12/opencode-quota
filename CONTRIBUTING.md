# Contributing to opencode-quota

Thanks for contributing! Please read this before you open an issue or PR.

## Issues first

- Open an issue before a feature, fix, refactor, or behavior change. Opening the issue and PR together is fine.
- Link it in the PR with `Fixes #<issue>` or `Refs #<issue>`. No issue? Explain the reason and scope in the PR.
- Use an issue form (bug, feature, or provider request). Write a short, specific title; the form adds the label, so skip `[bug]`-style prefixes.
- Very short or mostly empty issues get the `needs info` label. Adding the details removes it. `needs info` issues close after 21 days without activity; nothing else auto-closes.

## Setup

Node.js `^22.13.0 || >=23.4.0` and Bun `1.3.5`:

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
```

## Checks

Run these before opening a PR:

```sh
bun run check
bun run typecheck
bun run build
bun run test
```

- `bun run check` runs the pinned Biome linter and formatter over the repository. Use `bun run format` to apply formatting fixes.
- `bun run typecheck` runs `tsc --noEmit`.
- `bun run build` cleans `dist`, compiles the server and types, copies the bundled pricing snapshot, and precompiles the TUI entry.
- `bun run test` runs the full Vitest suite.

CI runs the same commands on a single Node 24 job. The release workflow publishes the built package to npm with provenance and OIDC trusted publishing.

## Rules the code must keep

- **No AI calls.** Never send a request to an AI model to produce anything the plugin shows (quota rows, reports, command output); it would spend the user's tokens. Calling a provider's quota or billing API is fine.
- **OpenCode 2 only.** No OpenCode 1 code, APIs, or tables.
- **Server vs. TUI.** The server plugin (`src/plugin.ts`) computes all text and registers the `/quota` command and the `npv12.opencode-quota` RPC. The TUI plugin (`src/tui-v2.tsx`) only draws what the RPC returns and never imports provider or credential code. Web and Desktop get the `/quota` report in the chat; OpenCode 2 has no plugin UI hooks there.
- **One command path.** The `/quota` command and the RPC `command` method go through `buildQuotaDialogCommandOutput()`.
- **Credentials.** Read OpenCode logins only through `ctx.integration` in `src/lib/opencode-auth.ts`. The only exception is the terminal `show` command (`src/lib/cli-show.ts`), which uses `src/lib/opencode-auth-sqlite.ts`; the plugins must never reach that file.
- **Money.** Show amounts with the provider's ISO code through the shared formatter (e.g. `USD 12.50`). No symbols, conversions, or adding up different currencies.
- Keep these boundary tests passing and up to date: `tests/plugin.command-handled-boundary.test.ts`, `tests/tui-dist-import-graph.test.ts`, `tests/quota-provider-boundary.test.ts`.

## Provider changes

**Built-in providers** are considered only when:

- the provider is on [models.dev](https://models.dev/),
- at least two independent users asked for it (your own request, repeat comments, and requests from the provider's own company don't count),
- it has a documented API (no login cookies or website scraping), and
- the PR links that evidence and explains why a custom provider isn't enough.

Even then, it needs a reasonable maintenance cost.

**Pick the right path:**

| You want to… | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Use an OpenAI-compatible model service OpenCode doesn't include | an OpenCode custom provider |
| Track quota for a provider OpenCode already exposes (request estimates or one fixed quota endpoint) | an OpenCode Quota custom provider (a global `quotaProviders` entry); its `providerId` must match OpenCode's |
| Anything the custom path can't do, and the policy above is met | a built-in provider |

**Building one:** for API-key or token providers, start from `contributing/provider-template/` (see its README), replace every example name, and add tests for every auth source. Use the README setup label that matches reality: `Automatic` or `Needs setup`.

**Every row** carries `AccountingMetadata`. Pick `resultType` by what the number means (`quota`, `rate_limit`, `usage`, `spend`, `budget`, `balance`, `status`), not by what's easiest to draw, and name the real source in `authority`. `user_configured` is only for a basis fact such as a user-set limit, never a row.

Rich providers (more than a percentage) also:

- send numbers as typed `quantity` rows or percentage `basis` facts, and booleans as `boolean` rows; never pre-formatted money strings;
- set `semantic` with an explicit `primary` or `supplementary` prominence;
- keep `used`, `limit`, and `remaining` literal;
- keep labels short: the concept only, no values, units, or reset text;
- format through the shared accounting formatter.

A simple percentage-only provider may keep the plain percent row, with accurate `AccountingMetadata`.

## Fixes

Make the smallest safe fix for the root cause. Match current OpenCode behavior instead of adding extra hook layers. Test against the current released OpenCode version and name it in the PR.

## Before-and-after screenshots (required)

Every PR that changes what users see must include before-and-after screenshots taken with the same config, model, theme, and window size, with credentials, account identifiers, and private paths hidden. For quota changes, report each surface: Web output, the TUI sidebar, and the `/quota` report (dialog or inline). Say which ones you didn't test. Tests don't replace screenshots, and screenshots don't replace tests. No visible change? Write `Not applicable` and why.

## PR checklist

- [ ] Linked issue, or a short reason there is none
- [ ] `bun run check`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run build`, and `bun run test` pass
- [ ] Tested on the current released OpenCode; version noted
- [ ] Before-and-after screenshots and surface results, or `Not applicable`
- [ ] Docs updated if commands, config, or workflow changed (usually `README.md`)
- [ ] New built-in provider: models.dev link, two independent requests, why custom isn't enough
- [ ] New API-key/token provider: started from the provider template, or explained why not
